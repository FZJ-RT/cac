# Chip Analyzer and Calculator (cac)
An open-source Python library for applying data-driven machine learning to analyze microfluidics experiments

## Introduction
'cac' provides data-driven machine learning methods for enabling an efficient and real-time analysis of microfluidics experiments. It uses [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for the implementation of data-driven machine learning methods, and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for image processing. It enables training with GPU, built on [Horovod](https://horovod.ai/). 

The current version (v1.0) contains only the implementation for data-driven machine learning methods. In the future, we will add more functionalities for the implementation of process-based machine learning methods. Stay tuned!

## Getting started
